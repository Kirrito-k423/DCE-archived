2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell nolabel_line18/nolabel_line18/v_reg[0]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) nolabel_line18/nolabel_line18/v_reg[0]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell nolabel_line18/nolabel_line18/v_reg[0]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) nolabel_line18/nolabel_line18/v_reg[0]_C/CLR, nolabel_line18/nolabel_line18/v_reg[0]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell nolabel_line18/nolabel_line18/v_reg[1]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) nolabel_line18/nolabel_line18/v_reg[1]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell nolabel_line18/nolabel_line18/v_reg[1]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) nolabel_line18/nolabel_line18/v_reg[1]_C/CLR, nolabel_line18/nolabel_line18/v_reg[1]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>
